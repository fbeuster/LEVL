Live edit and view for Lixter (short: LEVL) is a live HTML text editor, also known as WYSIWYG.

> **Note:** This project is in early development and might miss a few feature. Not might, it does.

If you're looking for a demo, check out the [page that I set up here](http://demos.beusterse.de/levl.html).

If you want to combine the JavaScript files, I recommend [JS Build](https://github.com/fbeuster/js-build)

## ToDo
- [ ] remove element formatting
- [ ] handle block level elements such as p and h2 better
- [ ] tag attributes
- [ ] format across multiple textnodes
